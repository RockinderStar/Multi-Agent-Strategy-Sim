# Multi-Agent-Strategy-Sim
This project is a Python-based multi-agent simulation that models competitive strategy switching with adaptive learning. It simulates two teams where one team dynamically adjusts its strategy based on previous successes and failures, using a simple reinforcement-inspired learning mechanism

Simulates adaptive strategy switching using probabilistic decision-making and reinforcement-style learning
